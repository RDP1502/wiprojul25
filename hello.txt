Exercise -7:
 
 
1.Create two branches called nov2025 and dec205 ( gitcheckout –b “nov2025” -> git push same for dec2025)
2.Git checkout nov2025 -> to make it current branch
3.Add any file and commit and push that should go to the nov2025 branch
4.Change the branch by using git checkout dec2025
5.You should not see the file that you created for the nov3025 branch
